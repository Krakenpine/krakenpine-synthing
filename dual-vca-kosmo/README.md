# Dual VCA v1.1

Simple dual VCA module in Kosmo format.
Files in KiCad format with schematic as pdf.
Jack pcb and main pcb are connected with a 10 pin flat cable, like the one powering eurorack/kosmo modules. Don't accidentally connect power to that connector, otherwise this should be quite straightforward if you have build anything previously.
This exact version of pcb has not been tested, first version had couple of easily fixable probles that I hopefully fixed also in the kicad file.

V1.1: fixed CV-limiting diode circuit to actually do something
