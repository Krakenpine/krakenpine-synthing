# No-fi delay v1.0

Very low fidelity delay module in Kosmo format. Uses Arduino Nano 328P version with 2 kB ram.
Install Mozzi library in Arduino IDE to use this.
Files in KiCad format with schematic as pdf.
Jack pcb and main pcb are connected with a 10 pin flat cable, like the one powering eurorack/kosmo modules. Don't accidentally connect power to that connector, otherwise this should be quite straightforward if you have build anything previously.
